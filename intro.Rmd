# Course Introduction

> Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: ‘There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics’.

**Mark Twain (1906)**

This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis for both undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bi-variate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced along with essential skills for cleaning data, creating plots, and reporting results. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines.

## Course Objectives

This course has four intertwined objectives. After completing the
course, students will be able to:

1.  *Fundamentals of inferential statistics*: Describe the use of
    various statistical tests, their requirements and assumptions, and
    their interpretation; execute these tests both by hand and
    programmatically using `R`.

2.  *Fundamentals of data analysis*: Perform basic data cleaning and
    analysis tasks programmatically using `R` in ways that support high
    quality documentation and replication.

3.  *Fundamentals of data visualization*: Create and present publication
    quality plots programmatically using `R` and `ggplot2`.

4.  *Quantitative research synthesis*: Plan, implement (using `R`), and
    present (using LaTeX and the presentation software of your
    choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a
    research question.
    
## Core Resources

There are three core documents and resources for this course. This **Syllabus** sets out core expectations and policies for the course. It includes a **Reading List** contains topics, readings (both required and optional), and assignment due dates for each week. These two documents spell out what is *required* for this course. Once the semester starts, these documents will only be updated if a schedule change is necessary.

In addition to these documents, regular updates will be provided on the [**course website**](https://slu-soc5050.github.io). Each week will have a corresponding page on the site that includes links to handouts, YouTube videos, sample code, and additional descriptions of concepts covered in class. Please check the website regularly for updates and new content.

All of our course content will be hosted through GitHub, where we have a [**course organization**](https://github.com/slu-soc5050). The course organization will contain *repositories* (a special type of folder) for each lecture as well as several repositories dedicated to specific aspects of the course. These repositories should be cloned as they are released and synced as they are updated.
