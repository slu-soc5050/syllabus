This is the hardcopy version of the \textbf{Fall 2018} syllabus.
\vspace{5mm}
\par \noindent This \texttt{.pdf} version of the course syllabus is automatically created as part of the document generation process. It is meant for students who wish to keep a hardcopy of the course policies and planned course schedule. This may be particularly useful for honors and M.A. students who plan to continue their graduate education after SLU and hope to petition out of a basic statistics requirement. \textbf{Since it is automatically created, it is not optimized for easy use} - readers may notice formatting inconsitencies and stray characters that are a result of the markdown to \LaTeX{} conversion process. The web version (located at \href{https://slu-soc5050.github/syllabus/}{https://slu-soc5050.github/syllabus/}) is meant to be the version of the syllabus used for everyday reference during the semester. As such, this \texttt{.pdf} version will not be updated as the semester progresses should any changes to the course schedule be necessary.
